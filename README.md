# SOC302-FINAL-PROJECT
A project analyzing the relationship between a variety of independent variables and their impact on one's belief on abortion rights. 

# INSTRUCTIONS
To access and utilize the script, open the "mitchell-abortion-rights.R" file, which contains the code for my findings. To access the dataset, please utilize the GSS Data Explorer exclusively using variables and data from 2022.

# DATA
The primary sampling strategy used by the GSS is cluster sampling to select respondents. It first divides the U.S. into geographic areas, then randomly selects clusters. Within these clusters, households are randomly chosen, and finally, one individual per household is randomly selected for the survey. The complete sample size when cross analyzing between political affiliation, gender, religion, income, confidence in people running healthcare, region of the US in which the interview took place, and belief in abortion rights for any reason resulted in a total of 662 out of the total 4,149 responses in the 2022 GSS population results. When exploring why my dataset is missing responses I noticed a few different explanations. To begin with, in one of my independent variables, political affiliation, 35 respondents did not answer this question meaning we cannot include them. Along with that, in regard to my dependent variable, belief in abortion rights for any reason, 2,367 were inapplicable for the question meaning they may have answered another question which resulted in them not being presented the question in general. Along with that, another 34 respondents simply did not answer the question. When taking this into account and applying this knowledge to the other independent variables that could be missing responses for similar reasons, this explains why my specific dataset does not match the overall population of the GSS.â€¯
